# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
Performing analysis on kickstarter data, with focus on outcomes based on goals and outcomes based on launch date to uncover trends. Discover how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

-Successful Campagins Outcomes vs. Launch Date
The line graph with launch date data in years 2009-2017, shows sucessful campaign outcomes reached its peak performance in May, followed by countinously declining till September. The outcomes have a slightly recovery in September and October, then drastically decreased again to its lowest point in December. 

However, if we look into individual years we can discover the graph states inconsistency in trend. For example:
Year 2010 - The peak performance month is in June, with an increase in its sucessful campaigns in November, reached the second highest point in December; 
Year 2012 - The outcomes dropped quite a few from March and reached a low point in May, which contradicts to the conclusion we earlier achieved;
Year 2013 - April became the best performing month through the year, follow by a decrease and reached to a low point in May. 

-Failed Campaigns outcomes vs. Launch Date
According to data in 2009-2017, failed campaigns outcomes sit in a stable range, and is not changed much through the year. Similar to what was discussed with outcomes for successful campagins, there are some exceptions if we dive into year by year datas: 
Year 2013 - The failed campaigns has significantly climbed up in September and dropped in November;
Year 2014 - The outcome increased from Feb till July, resulting even more failed than successed campaigns in July, August and September;
Year 2015 - Failed campagins outcomes have a decreasing trend through the year. 

In conclusion, with no other factors and variables given, it is inaccurate to conclude that launch date and campaigns outcomes are related.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

From the line graph we can see, campagin sucessful rate goes lower as the goals gets bigger. In the other word, the failed rate is higher as goals is bigger. 
Not hard to notice the goal range 30000 to 34999, 35000 to 39999, 40000 to 44999 has increased sucessful rate although the goals are greater. 



### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the theater Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
